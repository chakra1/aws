# A basic AWS Pipeline to stream JSON from Firehose to DynamoDB using Lambda

This project is meant to demonstrate beginner AWS users a basic AWS pipeline for a single JSON event generated by AWS CLI streamed through Kinesis Firehose delivery stream and using AWS Lambda for transformation before being written to DynamoDB.

This document gives a step-by-step guide for the configuration / set-up of the required AWS services as well as both custom and managed AWS policies needed as well as the details of the Python lambda data handler doing the transformation together with some screenshots.
